# Rules for using 2d10 instead of 1d20 for DD Next

## Regular roll

* Roll 2d10 and add the result of the two dice. If the sum is greater or equal than the target number, then you have a success. Otherwise, you have a failure.
* If the two dice are equal and your roll is a success, then it is a critical success.
* If the two dice are equal and your roll is a failure, then it is a critical failure.

## Advantage

* Roll 3d10 and take the two dice that have the highest value. 
* Add the result of those two dice. If the sum is greater or equal than the target number, then you have a success. Otherwise, you have a failure.
* If the two dice are equal and your roll is a success, then it is a critical success.
* If your roll is a failure and the **three** rolled dice are equal then it is a critical failure. Otherwise it is a regular failure (even if the two chosen dice are pair).

*Note :*

You take the dice that have the highest value, not the dice that are the best for you. 
This mean that if you roll [5, 5, 7] and have to reach 10, you take [5, 7] and not [5, 5]. 
Otherwise you would have a too high critical success ratio (with a +5 bonus, nearly 1/4 of the rolls would be critical hits).

Also, you have a critical failure only if the **three** rolled dice are equal. 
As for the critical successes, this rule prevent a too high critical failure ratio.
 
## Disadvantage

* Roll 3d10 and take the two dice that have the lowest value. 
* Add the result of those two dice. If the sum is greater or equal than the target number, then you have a success. Otherwise, you have a failure.
* If the two dice are equal and your roll is a failure, then it is a critical failure.
* If your roll is a success and the **three** rolled dice are equal then it is a critical success. Otherwise it is a regular success (even if the two chosen dice are pair).

*Note :* Those rules prevents a too high critical success and critical failure ratio. As for advantage.
