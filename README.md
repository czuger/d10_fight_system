# Rules for using 2d10 instead of 1d20 for dd next

## Regular roll

* Roll 2d10 and add the result of the two dice. If the sum is more or equal than the target number, then you have a success. Otherwise, you have a failure.
* If the two dice are equal and you roll is a success, then it is a critical success.
* If the two dice are equal and you roll is a failure, then it is a critical failure.

## Advantage

* Roll 3d10 and take the two dices that have the highest value. 
* Add the result of those two dice. If the sum is more or equal than the target number, then you have a success. Otherwise, you have a failure.
* If the two dice are equal and your roll is a success, then it is a critical success.
* If your roll is a failure and the **three** rolled dice are equal then it is a critical success. Otherwise it is a regular failure (even if the two chosen dice are pair)

*Note :*

* You take the dices that have the highest value, not the dice that are the best for you. Otherwise you would far too much critical hits.
  * With a +5 bonus, one fourth of the rolls would be critical hits, which is far too high.
* In the same way, you get a critical failure only if the **three** rolled dices are equal. Otherwise the amount of critical failure would be far too high.
